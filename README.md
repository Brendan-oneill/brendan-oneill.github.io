The only thing I could not get to work porperly was some margin and color declarations in index.css, I intended to have blue margins with a white background around content which would be centered. Instead my name is blue and everything is white. Otherwise everything else works as expected.

I worked on this assignment on my own, with the help of only Google

This took me around 3 and a half hours
